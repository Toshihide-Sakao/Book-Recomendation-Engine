# Elasticsearch Docker Setup
This project is a search application done as part of the course Search Engines and Information Retrieval Systems DD2477 @ KTH.
The application let's you search for new books to read. It allows you to add books you have read and personalizes the searches accordingly.
Additionally there are search filters for common generes and book rating.

Bellow is a step by step guide how to run the project.
